        <h3>My story</h3>
        <p class="mystory">I am a young Portuguese designer, in love with this area from an early age. I started my
            studies in design, right in high school and in 2018, I finished a degree in Communication Design at the
            Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon. I decided to "take the leap" to digital and right now, I'm
            taking a postgraduate degree in Digital Experience Design at the same college.</p>
